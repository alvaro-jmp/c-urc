# c-urc-garage-door-not-encrypted 

This is a program for a PIC16F690 microcontroller from a [project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IFt62EF3NbSOA1Vvz_oraNpHULJRAejd/view?usp=sharing) I did between 2012 - 2014 on a wireless universal remote control that learns the digital signal encoding of remote controls used for garages or parking gates that do not have any encryption. It also has the function of reproducing the digital signal encoding.

Itâ€™s not perfect at all, I may make modifications to the program and information will be added on how to install xc8, mplab x, how to build in mplab x and use the stimulus file to simulate certain functions in the mplab x simulator.
